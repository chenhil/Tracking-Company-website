#Tracking Website#

This repository contains an early example of using ASP.NET and related technologies
to build a working website. The example allows users to tracking there packages with given tracking number, and the owner is website is able to log-in and add tracking info for the "tracking number."

The purpose of the example is for my own investigation help understand how ASP.net works. The 
technologies used include:

* ASP.NET CORE
* AngularJS 
* Bootstrap 
* Entity Framework 
* ASP.NET Identity
* Visual Studio 2015
